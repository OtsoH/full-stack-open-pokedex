I will pick Python as the language used for the project. For the CI setup we will use pylint for checking the code quality and we will also use black for formatting. For testing we will use pytest for unit tests and robot tests for end-to-end testing. For building we use poetry as the environment. Some alternatives for Github actions and Jenkins include Gitlab and CricleCI. Gitlab might be a better choice if you want more advanced pipeline management and native, end-to-end integration of the entire Devops lifecycle. CircleCI, on the other hand is regarded as an incredibly fast alternative due to its optimized build infrastructure and superior caching capabilities. I would say that a cloud-based environment is generally a better choice, since the number of users is unknown, it allows for easier scalability, and if, for example, the expected number of users is much lower than the amount the self-hosted server can handle, you're effectively paying extra for nothing. Also, for such a small team, buying and maintaining physical hardware would probably be more expensive than paying regularly for a cloud instance. In addition, cloud services provide integrated tooling that makes setting up and automating CI/CD pipelines significantly faster, allowing this team to focus on shipping code rather than managing infrastructure.
